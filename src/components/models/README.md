# 3D Models Guide for Skills Section

## Current Issue
The current 3D models in the skills section don't match the cybersecurity skills they represent. For example, the React logo is being used for Network Security, and the Python logo for Python Security is appropriate but others need to be updated.

## How to Get Cybersecurity-Related 3D Models

### Option 1: Use Free 3D Model Repositories
1. Visit websites like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/), or [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/) to find free or paid 3D models related to cybersecurity.
2. Search for terms like "shield", "lock", "security", "firewall", "network", etc.
3. Download models in GLB or GLTF format (preferred for web use).

### Option 2: Create Simple Models with Blender (Free)
1. Download [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (free 3D modeling software)
2. Create simple 3D icons representing cybersecurity concepts:
   - Shield for Security Operations
   - Lock for Authentication
   - Network diagram for Network Security
   - Bug or magnifying glass for Security Analysis
   - Code with lock for Secure Development
3. Export your models as GLB files

### Option 3: Convert 2D Icons to 3D
1. Find cybersecurity-related SVG icons from sites like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) or [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)
2. Use tools like Blender or [Vectary](https://www.vectary.com/) to extrude the 2D shapes into 3D models
3. Export as GLB files

## How to Optimize and Use the Models

### Step 1: Optimize the Models
Large 3D models can slow down your website. Use tools like [gltf-pipeline](https://github.com/CesiumGS/gltf-pipeline) or [glTF Transform](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/) to optimize your models:

```bash
# Install gltf-pipeline
npm install -g gltf-pipeline

# Optimize a model
gltf-pipeline -i input-model.glb -o optimized-model.glb --draco.compressionLevel=10
```

### Step 2: Add Models to Your Project
1. Place the optimized GLB files in the `public/models/` directory
2. Update the `techStackIcons` array in `src/constants/index.js` to point to your new models:

```javascript
const techStackIcons = [
  {
    name: "Network Security",
    modelPath: "/models/network-security.glb", // Your new model
    scale: 1,
    rotation: [0, 0, 0],
  },
  // Update other entries with appropriate models
];
```

### Step 3: Adjust Scale and Rotation
You may need to adjust the `scale` and `rotation` properties for each model to ensure they display correctly. Test different values until the model appears correctly in your skills section.

## Alternative Solution: Use 2D Icons Instead

If creating or finding appropriate 3D models is too challenging, you can switch to using 2D icons instead:

1. Uncomment the `techStackImgs` section in `src/sections/TechStack.jsx`
2. Add appropriate cybersecurity icons to your `public/images/logos/` directory
3. Update the `techStackImgs` array in `src/constants/index.js` to point to your new icons

This approach is simpler but loses the 3D effect that makes your portfolio unique.
